Info Integratation Project 4290 


## Notes 

- Create a web app using python that a user can send text/input from one computer to another using the web app 
- We will use the two files in the repo as the base 
- Currently, the two files creates block hashes but they are not stored anywhere 
- Everytime the web app opens, it saves a copy of the blockchain 
- Need to decide how the blockchain is stored 

## Questions that need to be answer

- How to improve IOT device trust with blockchain?
